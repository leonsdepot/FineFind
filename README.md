## Compatibility

#### 🦊🔥 ✔

This extension is currently compatible with Firefox only. Some Firefox-based browsers, such as LibreWolf, should also be compatible, though their functionality cannot be guaranteed as they are not actively tested.

#### 🌐 ❌

Chrome and Chromium-based browsers are currently incompatible with the method FineFind uses to detect search results. If you discover a workaround, we encourage you to share it with us.

## How it works

To use FineFind, simply open your browsers native in-page search (Ctrl + F). FineFind will integrate seamlessly, displaying a green ring (customizable) as an indicator to highlight search results.

You can further customize your experience via the FineFind options page.

#### ℹ️ Notice of Restricted Websites

This extension does not work on certain websites like _addons.mozilla.org_, _accounts.firefox.com_, or _support.mozilla.org_ due to browser restrictions. [Read more](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Content_scripts#restricted_domains)
